What this code does, in essense, is it simulates a manager's deliberations over who to enter into their raffle. They decide to do this
by email type; that only those of a certain kind of email will be permitted entry.
The code takes input from the user in the form of a specified email type. It then iterates through a dictionary, with employee names as
keys and their email addresses as values. Using regular expressions, it locates what employees have the right email type and outputs the 
result.
